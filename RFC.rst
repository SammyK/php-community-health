Introduction
============

This RFC proposes that the PHP project should adopt a formal code of conduct
for its members.

The goal of this code of conduct is to give a clear signal what is expected of
contributors and project maintainers, regarding their conduct in discussions
on mailing lists, and other related communication channels. More specifically,
the expected conduct in discussing language improvements and changes through
the RFC process.

This proposal consists of several parts:

* The goal of the documents (this part)
* Contributor `Guidelines <contributor-guidelines.rst>`_ (also from
  original
  http://php.net/mailing-lists.php and
  http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=blob_plain;f=README.MAILINGLIST_RULES;hb=HEAD)
  files
* A general `Code of Conduct <code-of-conduct.rst>`_, which provides a general
  overview on what constitutes as unacceptable behaviour
* A `Contributor Mediation Team <mediation.rst>`_ to assess and act upon the
  complaints as received through the above procedures
* A set of `procedures <procedures.rst>`_ to follow if individuals wish to
  make complaints if other project members do not follow either the Code of
  Conduct or the Constructive Collaboration Guidelines.
* A set of `examples <examples.rst>`_ and thought experience on good and bad
  behaviour.

Updating Code Of Conduct

Any changes to the text of the above mentioned documents, minus grammatical and
spelling errors, but including the Contributor Guidelines, Code of Conduct, and
